# GRIP---The-Spark-Foundation - Task 1: Prediction of scores using Linear Regression Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
# Project Description

In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This task is a simple linear regression as it involves just two variables(Hours and Scores)
